# React photo browser

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Also includes:
* [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
* [React Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux)
* [Redux Saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga)

The photo browser retrieves images from [JSONPlaceholder](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) using Redux Saga and stores them in the application state using Redux.
